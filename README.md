# Bootstrap 5 Vite Starter Pack

## Introduction
Welcome to the Bootstrap 5 Vite Starter Pack! This project is designed to kickstart your web development using Bootstrap 5, Vite as the development server, and a set of powerful tools for optimizing and enhancing your project.

### Features
Bootstrap 5
Harness the power of Bootstrap 5 to create responsive and feature-rich web applications. Bootstrap provides a robust set of components and utilities for building modern and stylish interfaces.

### Vite Development Server

### PostCSS Setup
